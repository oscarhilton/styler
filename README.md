# React HTML styler

This app allows the user to style HTML elements directly from the browser and gives out useful CSS code for a designer to pass onto a developer or for a developer to get more hands on with design. A work in progress.

Install
```
yarn install
```

Run
```
yarn start
```

If you get into issues with node-sass, reinstall node-sass globally (working on a fix)
```
npm install -g node-sass
```
